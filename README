connect to lidar:
sudo dnsmasq -C /dev/null -kd -F 192.168.1.50,192.168.1.80,100h -i eth0 --bind-dynamic

wait for about 30s, until dnsmasq-dhcp: DHPACK(eth0) 192.168.1.78 .... os1XXXXXXXXX appears
ctrl+C to quit that process.Now you should be connected (try it by ping 192.168.1.78)

To run:
ssh into Jetson in at least two terminals:
```
$ ssh nvidia@192.168.1.100
``` 
In one of the Jetson terminal prompts (ssh) (this is where debug meassages are printed):
```
$ roslaunch asv_controller smart_cntrl.launch
```
In another Jetson terminal (ssh):
```
$ roslaunch lidar_reader lidar_transform.launch
```
Open Rviz on the host computer (not ssh shell):
```
$ rviz
```
If Rviz not configured to show the wanted topics these can be added by pressing the add button in the buttom left corner. 
Choose add by topic and add the wanted points. Add for instance lidar scans, reference points or whatever is of interest.
Save the changes, ctrl+C, to keep the vizualised topics until next time. If 'Smart' mode is running chose a start point by clicking
2D nav goal in the top bar of Rviz, then click on the map where you want the boat to go.

In another terminal prompt:
```
$ rosparam set /run True
$ rosparam set /I/reset True
  (the next command will start the vehicle)
$ rosparam set /motor_control/sim False
$ rosparam set /I/reset False
```
